# Interview Preperation Tracker
– Developed an interview preparation website where users will have different categories of selected questions
( such as DSA, Puzzles), users can also add their interview experiences and view others’ experiences once they are
logged in.
– Used Node.js and MongoDB for back-end development and EJS for front-end development.

The website is live at [link](https://interview-preperation.onrender.com/).
